# Curatorial Practices Extension of Smart Label PWA

This project was an extension of an ongoing research project for the Michigan State Univeristy Broad Art Museum. Due to COVID-19 research funding was re-allocated and this specific project was stopped. 

Due to COVID-19 the Senior Showcase for the curatorial practices class had been canceled. Our previous application allowed a way to allow even more research to be shown at the Virtual Exhibit I had also created. Within the virtual exhibit a visitor could scan the QR code at certain objects and be sent to a page with more images, descriptions, video, etc.

Code runs via Angular/ Bootstrap using WordPress REST API. A specific interface was created for curators to use at the museum within Wordpress. Afterwards the application would pull data from Wordpress and display it.
